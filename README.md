//This is inspired by my own story of adopting dogs. Based on the choices user makes the dog can be happy or it can lose it's life. 
//This is to show how users that caring for animals especially dogs is very crucial and if they do not treat the dog well, the dog will suffer. 
//This project aims to reflect on animal cruelty and how it is inhumane. And also how much happiness dogs can bring into our lives. 
//This sketch is the final version of the story.
